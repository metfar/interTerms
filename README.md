## Intro

This project tries to integrate different knowledges to eventually create a portable fantasy-computer emulator.

At this point it hardly has a screen, keyboard detection and a clock, but it will continue evolving.

## The name

It has not a proper name. This is just a project to work in when we have some spare time.

## Thanks

Thanks to anyone because of the patiente to try it out and/or contribute to this development!
